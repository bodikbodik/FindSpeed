# Linear calculation (findspeed)




## Task 1 
The speed of the boat in the stagnant water is _**V km/h**_, the speed of the river's flow is _**U km/h**_ (U < V). The boat's moving time in the lake is _**T1 h**_ and in the river (against the flow) is _**T2 h**_. Find  distance, that was passed by a boat _(distance = speed * time)_. Take into consideration that when the boat is moving against the flow, the boat`s speed decreases by the speed of flow. 

 

Example 

```
V = 20 km/h; U = 5 km/h; T1 = 2 h; T2 = 3 h  =>  Distance = 85 km 
V = 18.7 km/h; U = 3.2 km/h; T1 = 0.5 h; T2 = 1.25 h  =>  Distance = 28.73 km 
V = 22 km/h; U = 7.3 km/h; T1 = 2 h; T2 = 1.5 h  =>  Distance = 66.05 km 
```
 
## Task 2
The speed of the first car is **_V1 km/h_**, the speed of the second car is **_V2 km/h_**, the distance between them is **_S km_**. Find the distance between cars after **_T hours_**, if the cars are distancing from each other. _The given distance is equal the sum of the initial distance + the general way_, which was covered by cars; _the general way = time*total speed_.  

Example 

```
V1 = 90 km/h; V2 = 110 km/h; S = 65 km; T = 3 h  =>  Distance = 665 km 
V1 = 65.5 km/h; V2 = 90.4 km/h; S = 20.9 km; T = 1.5 h  =>  Distance = 254.75 km 
V1 = 70 km/h; V2 = 85.6 km/h; S = 32.6 km; T = 2 h  =>  Distance = 343.8 km  
```
